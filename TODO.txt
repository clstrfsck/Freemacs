Things to do:

1. Unify changing positions of things in windows by fixing the
   getMarkPosition()/setMarkPosition() interface.  This would
   include allowing things like setting point and topline via
   setMarkPosition().  getMarkPosition() seems to be OK.

2. Fix the window horriblness.  There is currently only one window
   and it is a global variable.

3. Some variables remain to be implemented.  All primitives are
   implemented.

4. Fix Fabsolute-filename in _file.min.  It has been coded with DOS
   assumptions.  It may be worthwhile implementing a primitive to
   do this, which would encapsulate the system dependent bits in
   the executable (which is probably the right place). Compare with
   #(nl) primitive for end of line.  DONE 20110225 - See abPrim
