==========================================

#(ba,X,Y)
---------
Buffer allocate/select.  "X" is interpreted as a decimal number.  If "X"
is less than zero, the current buffer number is returned.  If "X" equals
zero, then a new buffer is created, and its buffer number returned.  If
"X" is greater than zero, that buffer is selected and its number
returned if it exists, otherwise zero is returned.  If an existing
buffer is selected, and "Y" is non-null, the buffer is selected without
necessarily expanding its size, which is cheap and means that the buffer
cannot be modified.
Returns: The buffer number of the current/selected/created buffer, or
zero if no such buffer exists.

#(is,X,Y)
---------
Insert string.  Inserts string "X" into the current buffer.
Returns: Returns "Y" if inserted OK, null otherwise.

#(pm,X,Y)
-------
Push/pop mark.  If "X" is greater than zero, that many temporary marks
are stacked.  If "X" is less than zero, the absolute value of that many
permanent marks are stacked.  If "X" is zero, temporary marks are
unstacked.  All newly stacked marks are set to the current value of
point.
Returns: null if successful, "Y" in active mode if an error occurs (ie
"X" would case the mark stack to overflow).

#(sm,X,Y)
---------
Set mark.  Set user mark "X" to mark "Y".  If mark "Y" is not specified
or null, then "." is used.  The following values are acceptable for "Y":
    '0..9'  User temporary marks
    '@..Z'  User permanent marks
    '*'     If the current buffer is displayed in both windows, this is
            the value of point in the other window
    '>'     Character to the right of the point
    '<'     Character to the left of the point
    '['     First character in the file
    ']'     Last character in the file
    '^'     Beginning of the current line
    '$'     End of the current line
    '-'     First blank char to the left
    '+'     First blank char to the right
    '{'     First non-blank char to the left
    '}'     First non-blank char to the right
    '.'     Point
The following are valid values for "Y":
    '0..9'  User temporary marks
    '@..Z'  User permanent marks
    '*'     If the current buffer is displayed in both windows, this is
            the value of point in the other window
Returns: null

Returns: null

#(rm,X,Y)
-------
Read to mark.  Read from point to mark "X".  If there is insufficient
space for the string, "Y" is returned in active mode.
Returns: The buffer between point and mark "X" if enough space exists,
otherwise return "Y" in active mode.

-------
Read count.  Read count of characters between point and mark "X".
Returns: The number of characters between point and mark as a decimal
number.

between point and mark "Y".
Returns: "A" if insertion is successful, "B" otherwise.

#(an,X,Y,Z)
-----------
Announce.  Write on the console after the current window.  If "Y" is not
null, "X" is displayed after the top window, otherwise "X" and "Z"
are displayed at the bottom of the screen, with the cursor placed after
"X".
Returns: null

#(xy,X,Y)
---------
Goto X,Y.  Position the cursor at screen column "X", row "Y".  The top
row is row 0, and the left column is column 0.
Returns: null

#(it,X)
-------
Input timed.  Reads a character from the keyboard, waiting for "X"
hundredths of a second, or 0 if "X" is null.
Note: Key names are defined elsewhere.
Returns: The name of the key pressed, or "Timeout" if no key pressed.

#(bl,X,Y)
---------
Bell.  Ring the bell at frequency "X" for "Y" 18ths of a second.  If "X"
is 0, then the default frequency is used.  If "X" is less than zero then
a "visual bell" is rung instead.
Returns: null

#(rd,X)
-------
Redisplay the screen.  If "X" is non-null, the screen is completely
repainted.
Returns: null

#(st,X)
-------
Syntax table. Sets the syntax table to the form given by "X".
Syntax bits are as follows:
    bit 0  0 = blank, 1 = non-blank (used for word matching)
    bit 1  0 = not newline, 1 = newline
Returns: null

#(lp,X,Y,A,B)
-------------
Look pattern.  Set search pattern to "X".  If "A" is not null, then "X"
should be a regular expression (otherwise it's a string).  If "B" is not
null, then case should be folded.
Returns: "Y" in active mode if an error occurs (eg invalid regex
syntax), otherwise null.
  The following regular expression characters are supported:
      '*'         Zero or more
      '[a-z]'     Character class
      '[~a-z]'    Not character class
      '.'         Any character
      '^'         Beginning of line
      '$'         End of line

      '\w'        Word character
      '\W'        Not word character

#(l?,A,B,C,D,X,Y)
-----------------
Look and test.  "A", "B", "C" and "D" are marks.  The search occurs
between marks "A" and "B".  If the string (set by #(lp,...)) is found,
mark "C" is set to the start of the matched string, and "D" to the end.
"A" defaults to the beginning of file, "B" defaults to end of file, if
"C" is null, defaults to mark 0 and "D" defaults to mark 1.
Returns: "X" if pattern is found, "Y" otherwise.

#(tr,X,Y)
---------
Translate.  Translates from point to mark "X" using string "Y" as a
translation character set.  Each character is read from the buffer, and
if the ordinal value is less than the length of "Y", then it is replaced
with this character.
Returns: null

PRIMITIVES
==========

#(hl,X)
-------
Halt.  Exit to operating system with return code "X" interpreted as
decimal number.
Returns: does not return

#(ow,X)
-------
Overwrite screen.  Write literal string "X" on screen at the current
cursor position.
Returns: null

#(==,X,Y,A,B)
-------------
Equals.  Compare "X" and "Y" for equality.  To be equal, strings "X" and
"Y" must be the same length, and have exactly the same characters.
Returns: "A" if "X" and "Y" are equal, "B" otherwise.

#(!=,X,Y,A,B)
-------------
Not equals.  Convenience function equivalent to #(==,X,Y,B,A).
Returns: "A" if "X" and "Y" are not equal, "B" otherwise.

#(nc,X)
-------
Number of characters.
Returns: The length of string "X" in characters.

#(a?,X,Y,A,B)
-------------
Alphabetically ordered.
Returns: "A" if "X" is lexicographically less that "Y", otherwise
returns "B".

#(sa,X1,X2,X3,...,Xn)
------------------
Sort ascending.
Returns: Parameters "X1" through "Xn" sorted lexicographically and
separated by ",".

#(ds,X,Y)
---------
Define string.  A form with name "X" is defined with value "Y". If a
form named "X" already exists, then it's current value is discarded.
Returns: null

#(gs,X,Y1,Y2,...,Yn)
--------------------
Get string.  Form with name "X" is retrieved.  If the form contains any
parameter markers, P1..Pn, they are replaced with literal strings
Y1..Yn.
Returns: Form "X" with parameter markers replaced with literal strings
"Y1".."Yn".

#(go,X,Y)
---------
Get one.  Gets a character from form "X".  If the form cannot be found,
the null string is returned.  If the form is found, and the form pointer
is currently at the end of the form, string "Y" is returned in active
mode.  This is approximately equivalent to the TRAC #(cc,X,Y) primitive,
only argument markers appear to be returned in MINT.
Returns: The character from the form at the form pointer.

#(gn,X,Y,Z)
-----------
Get n.  Gets "Y" characters from form "X".  If form "X" cannot be found,
then "Z" is returned in active mode.  This differs from the TRAC
#(cn,...) primitive in that argument markers are returned, and negative
values of "Y" are not allowed.
Returns: "Y" characters from form "X" at the current form pointer.

#(rs,X)
-------
Reset string.  Resets the form pointer associated with form "X".
Returns: null

#(fm,X,Y,Z)
-----------
First match.  Finds the first match of literal string "Y" in form "X".
If the string is found, the form pointer is advanced to after the string
found, and the portion of the form before the matched string is
returned.  If form "X" cannot be found, null is returned.  If "Y" is
null, or cannot be found in form "X", then "Z" is returned in active
mode.
Returns: null if "X" cannot be found, the portion of the form "X" before
literal string "Y" if form "X" exists, or "Z" in active mode if "Y" is
null or cannot be found in "X".

#(n?,X,A,B)
-----------
Name exists?  Check to see if form given by literal string "X" exists.
Returns: "A" if form exists, "B" otherwise.

#(++,X,Y)
---------
Add.  Add literal strings "X" and "Y" interpreted as decimal numbers.
Numbers are interpreted from the right of a string, so for example
"123X789" has the value 789 as a decimal.  For mathematical functions,
the non-numerical prefix of "X" is prepended onto the result, so that
##(++,fish123,from321) gives "fish444".
Returns: The sum of "X" and "Y" when interpreted as decimal numbers.

#(--,X,Y)
---------
Subtract.  Subtract literal strings "X" and "Y" interpreted as decimal
numbers.  See #(++,X,Y) for more information about how numbers are
interpreted.

numbers.

#(&&,X,Y)
---------
And. See #(++,X,Y) for more information about how numbers are
interpreted.
Returns: The bitwise and of "X" and "Y" when interpreted as decimal
numbers.

#(^^,X,Y)
---------
Exclusive or. See #(++,X,Y) for more information about how numbers are
interpreted.
Returns: The bitwise exclusive or of "X" and "Y" when interpreted as
decimal numbers.

#(g?,X,Y,A,B)
-------------
Numeric greater than.
Returns: "A" if "X" is greater than "Y" when interpreted as numbers, "B"
otherwise.

#(ls,X,Y)
---------

------------------
Erase strings.  Remove all forms with names "X1", "X2", ..., "Xn".
Returns: null

#(ct,X,Y)
---------
Current time.  If "X" is null, returns system date/time.  If "X" is not
null, it is used as a filename.  If "X" is specified, then if "Y" is

output string.
Returns: ("X" null) System date in format "Sun Aug 08 09:01:03 2003".
Returns: ("X" not null, "Y" null) Date of file "X" in above format, or

Returns: ("X" not null, "Y" not null) Date of file "X" in above format,
with file attributes prepended as 6 binary digits, and file size
appended in the format "010000Sun Aug 08 09:01:03 2003 104323".  The
bits of the file attributes have the following meanings if set:
    Bit 0 - File is read only
    Bit 1 - File is hidden
    Bit 2 - File is a system file
    Bit 3 - File is a volume label
    Bit 4 - File is a directory
    Bit 5 - File is ready for archiving (modified since backup)

#(mp,X,Y1,Y2,...,Yn)
--------------------
Make parameters.  Form with name "X" is scanned for occurrences of the
literal sub-string Y1.  If any are found, they are replaced by special
parameter markers P1.  This process is repeated for Y2 through Yn,
replacing with parameter markers P2 through Pn.
Corresponds to the TRAC primitive #(ss,X,Y1,...,Yn).
Returns: null

#(hk,X1,X2,X3,...,Xn)
---------
Hook string.  Searches for forms named "X1", through "Xn".  If a form
that exists is found, evaluates using #(gs,...) using the remainder of
the arguments.  For example: #(hk,f1,f2,f3,f4) if form "f1" does not
exist, but form "f2" does, is equivalent to #(gs,f2,f3,f4).
Returns: Expanded version of first of form X1..Xn found, or null if no
form found.

#(si,X,Y)
---------
String index.  Look up each character of literal string "Y" in form
"X".  The raw ascii value of each character of "Y" is used as an index
into form "X".  If "X" does not exist, or if the ordinal of the
character of "Y" is greater than the number of characters in form "X",
then the character in question is not modified.  Used to translate from
lower to upper and vice versa.
Returns: Translated string.

#(bc,X,Y,Z)
-----------
Base conversion.  Convert "X" from base "Y" to base "Z".  Bases are as
follows:
    'a','c' ASCII - converts a single ASCII character to it's ordinal.
    'd'     Decimal
    'o'     Octal
    'h'     Hexadecimal
    'b'     Binary
Returns: "X" interpreted according to base "Y" in base "Z".

#(ff,X,Y)
---------
